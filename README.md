# Zaghawa Beria

## Project status [![Build Status](http://build.palaso.org/app/rest/builds/buildType:Fonts_ZaghawaBeria/statusIcon)](http://build.palaso.org/viewType.html?buildTypeId=Fonts_ZaghawaBeria&guest=1)  

**Update (2025-Sep-9):** A new font for the Beria Erfe script is now available. It is a Unicode-encoded font. The font can be downloaded from the [Kedebideri site](https://software.sil.org/kedebideri).

Zaghawa Beria is a legacy-encoded font for the Beria script. **Please note that this font is not encoded according to The Unicode Standard, as the Beria script has not yet been accepted into the standard. The letters are currently given Latin script codepoints while encoding proposals are in process. Once the script is accepted into Unicode this font will be deprecated in favor of a Unicode-encoded font. Please also do not make derivative fonts from this project at this time.**

For practical information about using, modifying and redistributing this font see [OFL-FAQ.txt](OFL-FAQ.txt).

**Note:** Please uninstall any previous versions of the **Zaghawa Beria** font that you may have installed before you install this version. The filename is slightly different and may cause the operating system to get confused if you do not uninstall the older version first.
