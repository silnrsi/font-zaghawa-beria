Zaghawa Beria is a legacy-encoded font for the Beria script. **Please note that this font is not encoded according to The Unicode Standard, as the Beria script has not yet been accepted into the standard. The letters are currently given Latin script codepoints while encoding proposals are in process. Once the script is accepted into Unicode this font will be deprecated in favor of a Unicode-encoded font. Please also do not make derivative fonts from this project at this time.**
